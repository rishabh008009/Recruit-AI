# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Recruit-AI Dashboard is a modern React-based applicant tracking system designed to help recruiters process hundreds of resumes efficiently using AI-powered scoring and automated workflows. The system provides an intelligent interface for Sarah, our primary user persona, to review candidates, view AI-generated fit scores, and execute automated communication workflows based on candidate quality.

## Glossary

- **Dashboard**: The main interface displaying metrics, active jobs, and candidate information
- **AI Fit Score**: A numerical score (0-100) generated by AI analysis comparing candidate qualifications against job requirements
- **Candidate Table**: The primary data grid displaying all candidates with their key attributes
- **Detail View**: A slide-over panel that displays comprehensive candidate information and automated action options
- **Auto-Pilot Actions**: Pre-configured workflow actions (interview invites or rejections) triggered based on AI Fit Score thresholds
- **Command Center**: The top section of the dashboard displaying key performance metrics
- **Active Jobs**: The list of open positions currently accepting applications
- **Mock Data**: Simulated candidate and job data stored in a TypeScript file for demonstration purposes
